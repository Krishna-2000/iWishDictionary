## Web Dictionary App(Spring + React.JS) ##

# Extract both the front end and backend folders into your local system.

1) Make the tables as per the sql commands in db.sql file, which is attached with this zip.
2) For the Backend Spring Boot :
	Wait till all the dependencies get downloaded automatically.
	change the application properties with your credentials(I have been using oracle database so my application properties had the oracleDB properties).
	Resolve any unknown errors.
	Run the application.
2) For Front-end React :
	Import the folder into your vscode.
	Run "npm i"
	Resolve unknown errors.
	Once the process is over, run "npm start"

*******Detailed way for using the application is mentioned in the attached manual****************

Thank You--
